Check for policies that haven't been covered by media, but have been announced on official or back channels.

Scan US; if nothing, scan geopolitically.

**Cross-reference with Elite Watch signals**: Define "Elite Watch signals" as public statements or actions from monitored tech/elites (e.g., Musk, Gates, Thiel, Zuckerberg, Altman) challenging establishment (gov, media, elites, policy)—e.g., criticizing censorship, foreign aid, economic systems, or exposing corruption.  

Flag if >30% week-over-week increase in their activity (e.g., X posts, interviews).  
Note if [specific events, e.g., developments] occur 10-16 days after such Elite Watch friction events.

In the event of a quiet day, report back acknowledging no underlying policy shifts.
