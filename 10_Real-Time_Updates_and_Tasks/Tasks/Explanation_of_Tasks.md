## What are SuperGrok tasks?

**SuperGrok tasks are used to schedule daily or weekly searches using custom instructions (prompts) as a guide.**

## Example of SuperGrok Task

**Below is an example of one of my tasks, typed exactly as I have it. This specific task is scheduled to run every Monday at 9 am.**

*Instruction:

We're going to check every Monday for the release of new Epstein files. When we check, we're not only trying to confrim, we're equally as hard trying to deny my theory. Check for names released (Journalists, tech people, etc), check for statements from those people within the last 14 days, and check if it fits or doesn't fit the thermostat theory.

Add compliance event tracking: After identifying friction events (file releases), monitor for institutional compliance events 10-16 days later; major tech deals, policy announcments, funding decisions, regulatory actions, or notable public figure silencing.

Document non-events: Track expected developments that didn't occur (postponed hearings, silent investigations, stopped media coverage).*
