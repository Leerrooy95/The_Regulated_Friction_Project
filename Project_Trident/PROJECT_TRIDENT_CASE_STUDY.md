# PROJECT TRIDENT: Case Study on Temporal Correlation & Infrastructure

## Executive Summary
Project Trident analyzes the synchronization of "Signal" events (Ritual) and "Anchor" events (Infrastructure/Finance). By cross-referencing `ritual_events_parsed.csv` and `anchor_events_parsed.csv`, we have identified a persistent Pearson correlation (**r = 0.6196**) for 14-day lags between specific signals and institutional outcomes.

## Phase I: The July 2025 Window
The most significant data cluster occurs in July 2025, mapping a direct line from ritual signaling to hardware activation:
1. **Trigger:** Red Heifer Ceremony (July 1, 2025) - recorded in `project_trident_final_dossier.csv`.
2. **Signal:** Oracle Jerusalem Underground Data Center Activation (July 15, 2025).
3. **Outcome:** US AI Infrastructure Executive Order (July 23, 2025).

## Phase II: Statistical Distribution
Based on `temporal_correlations_analyzed.csv`, the project tracked 338 unique correlations within a ±14-day window.

| Ritual Type | Total Correlations | Percentage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Evangelical Temple Delegation | 170 | 50.3% |
| Papal Extraordinary Consistory | 90 | 26.6% |
| Foundation Stone Laying | 55 | 16.3% |
| Other (Sanhedrin/Mufti/Ceremony) | 23 | 6.8% |

## Conclusion
The data suggests that specific ritual events serve as high-reliability indicators for subsequent moves in AI infrastructure and sovereign data sovereignty. The density of these clusters in late 2025 (December 10–23) suggests a coordinated "Go-Live" phase for the infrastructure projects tracked in this repository.
