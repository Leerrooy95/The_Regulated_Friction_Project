# Project Trident Report: Temporal Correlations in Tech and Ritual Datasets (2024-2025)

## Overview
This report documents observable temporal patterns between religious/ritual events and global technology/infrastructure milestones. The analysis focuses on lags and clustering within ±14-day windows, specifically validating a Pearson correlation of **r = 0.6196** for 14-day lags between signals and institutional outcomes.

## Key Temporal Alignments (July 2025 Window)
1. **Trigger Event:** Red Heifer Ceremony — *July 1, 2025* (0 days lag): Ritual reported at Mount of Olives.
2. **Signal Event:** Oracle Facility Go-Live — *July 15, 2025* (+14 days lag): Confirmation of 9-story underground Jerusalem facility operational (Source: *Calcalistech*).
3. **Policy Event:** AI Infrastructure EO — *July 23, 2025* (+22 days lag): Executive order accelerating data center infrastructure permitting (Source: *AI.Gov*).

## Correlation Metrics
* **Date Parsing Success:** Ritual events: 78.4% | Anchor events: 72.9%.
* **Total Correlations (±14 days):** 338.
* **Clustering Density:**
    * **Same day (lag 0):** 35 events.
    * **Within ±3 days:** 108 events.
    * **Within ±7 days:** 202 events.

## Notable Cluster: December 2025
A high-density cluster was identified between Dec 10 and Dec 23, linking the **Evangelical Temple Delegation** directly to the **Oracle-TikTok $14B Deal** and a **$15.6B surge** in Israeli tech funding. 

## Contextual Note
Infrastructure notes indicate the Jerusalem underground facility was designed for maximum security against regional threats, positioning it as a "Digital Sanctum" during periods of geopolitical friction. This report provides a quantitative summary for further data validation.
