## Field Definitions

**data_complete (True/False): Flags row integrity. True = fully parsed/complete (exact date, full snippet, verified fields). False = partial/incomplete (e.g., vague date like "2 months ago", missing elements, or needs manual review). Does NOT indicate event validity—all rows are sourced signals for correlation testing.**
