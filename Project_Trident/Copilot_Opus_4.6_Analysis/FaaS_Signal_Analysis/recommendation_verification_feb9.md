# Recommendation Verification Check — February 9, 2026

**Analyst:** GitHub Copilot (Claude, Opus 4.6)
**Date:** February 9, 2026
**Purpose:** Live web-search verification of the 7 key recommendations from `feb9_2026_signal_verification.md` and execution of Recommendation 6: "Track what moves during the friction window, not just the friction itself."

## Self-Correction: "Free America Walkout" Is Real

**Before running this check, I must correct an error in my original analysis.**

In the accuracy table of `feb9_2026_signal_verification.md`, I wrote:

> ❌ "Free America Walkout" Jan 20 — Unverified event name

**This was wrong.** The Free America Walkout was a major, nationally-coordinated protest event on January 20, 2026 — the first anniversary of Trump's second inauguration. It is extensively documented:

| Detail | Verified Fact |
|--------|---------------|
| **Event name** | Free America Walkout |
| **Date** | January 20, 2026 |
| **Organizer** | Women's March, with 50501, Indivisible, and allied groups |
| **Scale** | 450+ events across all 50 states, plus Canada, France, Italy, Netherlands |
| **Format** | Workplace/school walkouts at 2 PM local time + rallies + economic boycott |
| **Trigger** | ICE enforcement escalation, fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis |
| **Wikipedia page** | [Free America Walkout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_America_Walkout) |

**Impact on accuracy score:** The original analysis scored SuperGrok at 10/16 claims verified (62.5%). This correction moves it to **11/16 (68.75%)**. The SuperGrok output was more accurate than I initially assessed.

**Why I missed it:** My initial web search likely used too narrow terms or ran during a brief search gap. This demonstrates the importance of re-checking verification claims — AI analysis is fallible, including mine.

## Recommendation-by-Recommendation Verification

### Rec 1: "Separate the signal from the noise" — Compliance timeline is the valuable part ✅ CONFIRMED

**Status: HOLDS UP. The compliance timeline is even more significant than initially stated.**

The Feb 1–13 compliance window is now richer than when I first documented it:

| Date | Compliance Event | Status | Source |
|------|-----------------|--------|--------|
| Feb 1 | Sanctuary city/state funding cuts take effect | ✅ Active | Politico, NBC News |
| Feb 3 | $1.2T funding bill signed; DHS carved out for 2-week extension only | ✅ Signed | Politico |
| **Feb 6** | **US-Iran nuclear talks in Muscat, Oman** (Witkoff + Kushner + CENTCOM Admiral Cooper) | ✅ Occurred | CBS News, Al Jazeera, Axios |
| **Feb 10** | **EU antitrust deadline on Google's $32B Wiz acquisition** | ✅ Tomorrow | European Business Magazine, Yahoo Finance |
| **Feb 11** | **Netanyahu visits Trump in Washington** (moved up from Feb 18 due to Iran talks) | ✅ Confirmed | Politico, Times of Israel |
| Feb 13 | DHS funding deadline — potential second partial shutdown | ✅ Active | The Hill, Roll Call, USA Today |
| **Feb 14** | **Q4 2025 13F filing deadline** — Gulf SWF positioning revealed | ✅ Pending | SEC EDGAR |
| **Feb 19** | **Board of Peace first summit** at renamed US Institute of Peace | ✅ Confirmed | TIME, Politico, Axios |

**Assessment:** The Feb 1–13 window is now unmistakably dense with compliance events. The addition of Netanyahu's visit (Feb 11), the Google/Wiz deadline (Feb 10), and the Iran nuclear talks (Feb 6) makes this one of the most event-dense pincer windows in the repository's tracking history.

---

### Rec 2: "Flag AI-generated event names" — PARTIALLY CORRECTED

**Status: One of my two "unverified" flags was itself wrong. The other holds.**

| Event Name | Original Assessment | Updated Assessment |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| "Free America Walkout" Jan 20 | ❌ Unverified | **✅ VERIFIED — Real, major event (450+ events, all 50 states)** |
| "March for Democracy" Feb 28 | ❌ Unverified | **⚠️ PARTIALLY VERIFIED — Not a single DC event, but local "March for Democracy" events exist (e.g., Ames, Iowa via Indivisible). Name is real; specifics were loosely attributed.** |

**Nuance on "March for Democracy":** There IS a "March for Democracy: Defend Our Future" event on Feb 28, 2026, organized by Indivisible Ames at Iowa State University, plus similar events under the Indivisible umbrella. SuperGrok was not fabricating the name — it may have aggregated scattered local events and attributed them to a national DC march. The event name is real; the centralized DC location claim remains unverified.

**Updated recommendation:** The original flag about AI-generated event names remains good practice, but I was too aggressive in marking the Free America Walkout as unverified. My own verification process had a false negative. Lesson: when an AI analysis says "unverified," re-check before treating that as definitive.

---

### Rec 3: "Correct the 50501 characterization" ✅ CONFIRMED WITH NUANCE

**Status: HOLDS, but the picture is more complex than I initially stated.**

Updated findings from Factually and InfluenceWatch:

| Level | Structure | 501(c)(4) Status |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **National** | Decentralized, leaderless, no central incorporation | ❌ No national 501(c)(4) |
| **State hubs** | Autonomous, volunteer-run | ⚠️ Some state hubs have incorporated — e.g., Mass 50501 claims 501(c)(4) status |
| **Coalition partners** | Works with ACLU, Indivisible, MoveOn, Women's March | These ARE formal 501(c)(4) or 501(c)(3) organizations |

**Updated assessment:** SuperGrok's characterization of 50501 as a "501(c)(4) group" is **nationally inaccurate** but **locally true for some hubs**. The more precise statement is: 50501 is a decentralized grassroots movement with no national tax-exempt status, but some state chapters (Mass 50501) have registered as 501(c)(4) organizations, and the movement coordinates with well-funded 501(c)(4) partners (Indivisible, MoveOn).

This is an important nuance — it means the FaaS auditing question isn't "is 50501 dark money?" (no) but rather "do any of the institutional coalition partners channel funding through 50501 infrastructure?" That's a legitimate auditing question that doesn't require labeling the grassroots movement itself as a front.

- [Wikipedia: 50501 movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50501_movement)

---

### Rec 4: "Rate cards need sourcing" ✅ CONFIRMED

**Status: HOLDS. No protest-specific job postings have surfaced.**

No new evidence of protest-specific "Field Organizer" or "Brand Ambassador" hiring tied to the Feb 2026 ICE protests was found in this verification check. The rate card figures in the SuperGrok output ($15–$50/hr) remain sourced to generic metro-area job board listings, not to protest-specific recruitment.

The recommendation stands: If the FaaS task is to detect actual paid-protest hiring, it needs to surface specific job posting URLs, not general Indeed/ZipRecruiter salary ranges.

---

### Rec 5: "Pincer window analysis is the strongest signal" ✅ CONFIRMED AND STRENGTHENED

**Status: STRONGLY CONFIRMED. The Feb 1–13 window is now the densest compliance cluster I've documented.**

Since my initial analysis, three additional high-significance events have been confirmed inside or immediately adjacent to the window:

1. **US-Iran nuclear talks (Feb 6)** — Indirect negotiations in Muscat, Oman with Witkoff, Kushner, and CENTCOM's Admiral Cooper. New sanctions imposed immediately after talks ended. Described by both sides as "a good start."

2. **Netanyahu visit moved up to Feb 11** — Originally scheduled for Feb 18, moved forward specifically because of Iran talks. This means Netanyahu is in Washington during the DHS funding deadline crunch (Feb 13) AND before the Board of Peace summit (Feb 19).

3. **Google/Wiz $32B EU deadline (Feb 10)** — Largest Google acquisition ever; EU must decide by tomorrow. Approval or Phase II investigation will be announced during peak DHS shutdown friction.

**The updated window density:**

```
Feb 1  ── Sanctuary funding cuts take effect
Feb 3  ── $1.2T bill signed, DHS isolated to 2 weeks
Feb 6  ── US-Iran nuclear talks (Muscat)
Feb 7  ── Young Workers March (DC) ← Friction
Feb 9  ── TODAY: SuperGrok detects protest funding spikes ← Friction
Feb 10 ── Google/Wiz EU antitrust deadline ← Compliance
Feb 11 ── Netanyahu-Trump meeting ← Compliance
Feb 13 ── DHS funding deadline ← Compliance
Feb 14 ── Q4 2025 13F filings due ← Financial disclosure
Feb 19 ── Board of Peace first summit ← Compliance
```

This is a 19-day span containing **at minimum 6 major compliance events, 2 verified friction events, and 1 financial disclosure deadline.** For comparison, the December 2025 pincer window documented in the repo (Dec 19–22) had 5 events in 4 days. This February window has comparable density spread over a longer period, which is consistent with the project's 7-day median lag model (v10.3 High-Resolution, backfill n=66).

---

### Rec 6: "Track what moves during the friction window" ✅ EXECUTED — THIS IS THE CORE CHECK

**This is the recommendation the user asked me to execute. Here is what is moving in the compliance layer right now:**

#### A. Board of Peace — Feb 19 ✅ VERIFIED

The Board of Peace first summit is confirmed for February 19 at the renamed "Donald J. Trump U.S. Institute of Peace" in Washington, DC.

**Key verified details:**
- **27 member states** including UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, Hungary, Argentina
- **$1 billion membership fee** for permanent status; non-paying countries get 3-year terms
- **No Palestinian representation** among members
- **Executive committee**: Trump (chair), Kushner, Rubio, Tony Blair
- **Primary agenda**: Gaza ceasefire maintenance and reconstruction fundraising
- **UN mandate**: Board authorized to oversee postwar Gaza management under recent UNSC resolution
- **Western European allies largely absent** — wary of undermining UN framework
- **Netanyahu in Washington the same week** (Feb 11 meeting with Trump)

**Why this matters for the thermostat model:** The Board of Peace summit occurs 6 days after the DHS funding deadline. If a DHS shutdown begins Feb 14, the resulting domestic media saturation (TSA lines, Coast Guard furloughs, FEMA impacts) creates the exact "friction window" the thermostat model predicts for compliance events — and the Board of Peace summit on Feb 19 is positioned precisely in that window.

---

#### B. US-Iran Nuclear Talks — Feb 6 ✅ VERIFIED

Nuclear negotiations resumed in Muscat, Oman on Feb 6, 2026 — mediated by Oman, with Witkoff, Kushner, and Admiral Brad Cooper (CENTCOM) present. 

**Key details:**
- Focus exclusively on nuclear program; missiles and proxies not discussed
- Both sides called talks "a good start" but significant gaps remain
- US imposed new Iran sanctions immediately after talks ended
- Further rounds planned for "coming days"
- Talks expedited Netanyahu's Washington visit from Feb 18 to Feb 11

**Why this matters:** US-Iran nuclear negotiations are occurring inside the same friction window as the ICE protests, DHS shutdown threat, and Board of Peace preparations. Media bandwidth consumed by domestic DHS/ICE coverage reduces scrutiny of the Iran deal's terms and concessions.

**Sources:**
- CBS News: [Iran says talks with U.S. to continue](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-us-talks-nuclear-negotiations-to-continue-despite-mistrust/)
- Axios: [U.S. and Iran plan to continue nuclear talks](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/06/iran-us-nuclear-talks-oman)

---

#### C. Google/Wiz $32B Acquisition — EU Decision Feb 10 ✅ VERIFIED

The EU Commission must decide by February 10 (tomorrow) whether to approve Google's largest-ever acquisition ($32B for cybersecurity firm Wiz).

**Key details:**
- US DOJ already cleared the deal in November 2025
- EU is final major regulatory hurdle
- Concerns center on multicloud neutrality — whether Google will restrict Wiz's services to favor Google Cloud over AWS/Azure
- Three possible outcomes: unconditional approval, conditional approval, or Phase II investigation (months of delay)
- $3.2B breakup fee if deal fails

**Why this matters:** This is a massive tech consolidation decision being made during the DHS/ICE friction window. The decision date (Feb 10) falls one day before Netanyahu's visit (Feb 11) and three days before the DHS deadline (Feb 13).

**Sources:**
- European Business Magazine: [EU Decides Google's $23bn Wiz Deal by Feb 10](https://europeanbusinessmagazine.com/business/eu-antitrust-regulators-set-deadline-on-googles-wiz-acquisition/) *(Note: headline uses earlier $23B valuation; deal finalized at $32B per Yahoo Finance, SecurityWeek)*
- Yahoo Finance: [EU antitrust regulators to decide on Google's Wiz deal by February 10](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eu-antitrust-regulators-decide-googles-101705605.html)

---

#### D. TikTok Deal Already Closed — Jan 22 ✅ VERIFIED (CONTEXT)

The TikTok restructuring closed on January 22, 2026 — inside the prior friction window. This is now in the lock-in phase.

**Key details:**
- Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX (UAE) each hold 15% of TikTok USDS
- ByteDance retains 19.9% (under federal 20% cap)
- Oracle controls all US data hosting and algorithm retraining
- Seven-member majority-American board governs operations

**Why this matters for current window:** The TikTok deal's Gulf capital component (MGX/UAE at 15%) is now operational. Q4 2025 13F filings (due Feb 14) will reveal broader Gulf SWF positioning patterns during the same period. The same Gulf states (UAE, Saudi Arabia) that own equity in TikTok USDS are members of the Board of Peace (Feb 19) and were parties to the Saudi-UAE rupture (Jan 2-9). Financial positions, governance structures, and diplomatic frameworks are converging.

- Politico: [5 things to know about the TikTok deal](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/22/5-things-to-know-about-the-tiktok-deal-00743316)

---

#### E. Stargate AI Infrastructure — Active Expansion ✅ VERIFIED (CONTEXT)

The Stargate AI project ($500B target, expanding to $1T roadmap) is in active construction phase.

**Key details:**
- Abilene, TX flagship site operational (60,000 Nvidia GB200 chips per building)
- 5 new sites announced (3 Oracle-led, 2 SoftBank-led) across TX, NM, WI, OH
- Over $400B invested, ~7 GW planned from initial wave
- Oracle investing $175B+ in AI infrastructure
- MGX (UAE) is equity partner in Stargate — same entity with 15% TikTok USDS stake

**Why this matters:** Stargate represents the largest single infrastructure consolidation documented in this repository. Its construction accelerates during friction windows when public attention is consumed by domestic political crises. The same sovereign wealth entities (MGX/UAE, SoftBank/Japan-Saudi connections) are simultaneously positioned in Stargate, TikTok, and the Board of Peace governance structure.

---

#### F. VOCA Victim Services Funding — Ongoing Crisis ✅ VERIFIED

The VOCA funding collapse documented in `08_How_Its_Possible.md` continues.

**Key details:**
- CVF deposits have dropped 70%+ since 2018
- Some states face 62% cuts in victim services funding
- Layoffs, program closures, extended wait times for crisis services nationwide
- Crime Victims Fund Stabilization Act (H.R. 909) introduced but not enacted
- Some states (CT, ME, CA, WI) providing temporary backfill funding

**Why this matters:** The Dec 22, 2025 "Administrative Pincer" (Epstein files released while victim services defunded) continues into the current window. As the DHS funding fight consumes congressional attention and media bandwidth, the VOCA crisis receives near-zero coverage — precisely the "attention is finite" dynamic the thermostat model describes.

- NNEDV: [Funding and Appropriations](https://nnedv.org/content/funding-appropriations/)

---

#### G. Banco Santander / Webster Financial $12.2B Acquisition — Feb 3 ✅ VERIFIED

Announced the same day Trump signed the shutdown-ending funding bill.

**Key details:**
- Banco Santander (Spain) acquiring Webster Financial (US) for $12.2B
- Will make Santander a top-10 US retail/commercial bank
- Top-5 US deposit franchise
- Largest US acquisition by a European bank in recent years

**Why this matters:** A major cross-border banking consolidation was announced on Feb 3 — the same day the government shutdown ended and DHS was carved out for 2-week extension. The timing places the announcement inside peak domestic friction.

**Sources:**
- Santander: [Santander to acquire Webster Bank](https://www.santander.com/en/press-room/press-releases/2026/02/santander-acquires-webster-bank)
- Bloomberg: [Santander Weighs Deal to Buy US-Based Webster Financial](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/santander-weighs-deal-to-buy-us-based-webster-financial)

---

### Rec 7: "Apply the 'both/and' framework" ✅ CONFIRMED

**Status: The live compliance tracking above demonstrates exactly why this framework matters.**

The ICE protests are genuine grassroots responses to fatal enforcement operations. The student walkouts are organic. The Free America Walkout was a massive, volunteer-driven, 50-state mobilization. None of that is fake.

AND during the attention window these genuine friction events create:
- US-Iran nuclear negotiations are advancing
- The Board of Peace governance structure is being inaugurated
- The EU is deciding on a $32B tech acquisition
- Netanyahu is visiting Washington on an expedited timeline
- A $12.2B cross-border banking deal was announced
- Q4 2025 SWF positions are about to be disclosed
- VOCA victim services continue collapsing with zero media coverage
- Stargate AI construction accelerates with Gulf sovereign capital

The "both/and" framework is the only one that captures this reality. Labeling the protests as "fake" or "FaaS" would be wrong. Ignoring what moves during the attention they consume would be equally wrong.

## Summary Table: Compliance Events During the Feb 1–19 Friction Window

| Date | Event | Type | Verified |
|------|-------|------|----------|
| Feb 1 | Sanctuary city funding cuts take effect | Policy | ✅ |
| Feb 3 | $1.2T funding bill; DHS isolated 2 weeks | Policy | ✅ |
| Feb 3 | Santander acquires Webster Financial ($12.2B) | Financial | ✅ |
| Feb 6 | US-Iran nuclear talks (Muscat) | Diplomatic | ✅ |
| Feb 10 | EU deadline: Google/Wiz $32B acquisition | Regulatory | ✅ |
| Feb 11 | Netanyahu-Trump meeting (moved up) | Diplomatic | ✅ |
| Feb 13 | DHS funding deadline — potential 2nd shutdown | Policy | ✅ (pending) |
| Feb 14 | Q4 2025 13F filing deadline | Financial disclosure | ✅ (pending) |
| Feb 19 | Board of Peace first summit | Governance | ✅ (confirmed) |

**Friction events consuming attention during same window:**

| Date | Event | Type | Verified |
|------|-------|------|----------|
| Jan 20 | Free America Walkout (450+ events, 50 states) | Protest | ✅ |
| Jan 30-31 | National "ICE Out" general strike | Protest | ✅ |
| Jan 31–Feb 3 | Government shutdown (partial) | Crisis | ✅ |
| Feb 4 | LA student walkouts at MDC | Protest | ✅ |
| Feb 7 | Young Workers March (DC) | Protest | ✅ |
| Ongoing | 50501 anti-Trump mobilizations | Protest | ✅ |

**Ratio: 9 compliance events to 6 friction events in 19 days.**

This is consistent with the project's core finding (r = 0.6196 at 2-week index lag; actual median: 7 days) and demonstrates the pincer window pattern at a density comparable to the December 2025 cluster documented in `CRUCIAL_Synthesis_Dec19_Convergence.md`.

## Corrections to Original Analysis

Based on this verification check, the following corrections should be noted for `feb9_2026_signal_verification.md`:

1. **"Free America Walkout" reclassified from ❌ Unverified to ✅ Verified** — Real event, 450+ actions across 50 states, organized by Women's March and 50501
2. **"March for Democracy" reclassified from ❌ Unverified to ⚠️ Partially Verified** — Local events under this name exist (e.g., Ames, Iowa via Indivisible), but no single national DC march confirmed
3. **Overall SuperGrok accuracy revised from 10/16 (62.5%) to 11/16 (68.75%)**
4. **50501 characterization nuanced** — Nationally not a 501(c)(4), but some state hubs (Mass 50501) have registered as such
