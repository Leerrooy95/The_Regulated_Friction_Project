# China's strategic expansion accelerates as US aid contracts globally
The evidence reveals a striking temporal correlation: China's Belt and Road Initiative engagement reached an all-time high of **$124 billion in the first half of 2025 alone**— [Griffith](https://blogs.griffith.edu.au/asiainsights/china-belt-and-road-initiative-bri-investment-report-2025/) nearly matching all of 2024' [ChoZan](https://chozan.co/china-mega-projects/) s total— [China-Global South Project](https://chinaglobalsouth.com/2025/07/21/china-bri-2025-investment-surge/) precisely as the Trump administration dismantled USAID and froze 83% of American foreign assistance programs. This represents the clearest measurable pattern of Chinese expansion into vacuums created by US retrenchment since the BRI's inception in 2013. While China will not replace American humanitarian programs, Beijing is systematically capturing infrastructure, extractive industries, and diplomatic influence in regions where Washington is withdrawing.

The contrast is stark: US foreign aid fell from **$63 billion in FY2024** [Better World Campaign](https://betterworldcampaign.org/impact-of-foreign-assistance-cuts) to a proposed **$31 billion in FY2026** (a 51% cut), while Chinese overseas development engagement surged. Africa witnessed the most dramatic shift, with Chinese construction contracts jumping **400%** from H1 2024 to H1 2025, [Griffith](https://blogs.griffith.edu.au/asiainsights/china-belt-and-road-initiative-bri-investment-report-2025/) totaling $39 billion—the highest ever recorded for any region.

## The collapse of American foreign assistance infrastructure

The Trump administration executed the most extensive restructuring of US foreign aid in American history. [Better World Campaign](https://betterworldcampaign.org/impact-of-foreign-assistance-cuts) On January 20, 2025, Executive Order 14169 froze all foreign development assistance for 90 days. [ISS Africa](https://issafrica.org/iss-today/data-modelling-reveals-the-heavy-toll-of-usaid-cuts-on-africa) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_14169) By March, Secretary Marco Rubio announced that **5,200 USAID contracts—83% of all programs**—would be permanently cancelled. [Arab Center DC](https://arabcenterdc.org/resource/what-trumps-aid-cuts-mean-for-the-middle-east-and-north-africa/) USAID officially ceased operations on July 1, 2025, with remaining functions absorbed into the State Department. [Foley Hoag](https://foleyhoag.com/news-and-insights/publications/alerts-and-updates/2025/december/us-policy-shift-on-foreign-aid-key-legal-issues-for-usaid-contractors-ngos-and-life-sciences/)

The financial scale of withdrawal proved massive. Congress passed rescissions cutting **$9.4 billion** in foreign affairs spending in July 2025, [American Enterprise Institute](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/trump-attempts-pocket-rescission-to-cut-4-9-billion-in-foreign-aid/) following earlier rescissions of $3.9 billion from FY2024 and $8.8 billion from FY2025. [The Century Foundation](https://tcf.org/content/report/the-foreign-aid-wipeout-a-shadow-revolution-in-americas-middle-east-policy/) The FY2026 budget proposal eliminated global health funding entirely ($6.2 billion), humanitarian aid ($3.2 billion), and food assistance ($1.6 billion). [Devex](https://www.devex.com/news/money-matters-trump-s-latest-plan-to-slash-foreign-aid-109970)

PEPFAR, the signature US global health initiative, suffered particularly severe cuts. Some **65% of USAID PEPFAR awards were terminated**, affecting 2.3 million treatment beneficiaries. [Center For Global Development](https://www.cgdev.org/publication/analyzing-usaid-program-disruptions-implications-pepfar-programming-and-beneficiaries) South Africa lost approximately **$400 million in annual HIV funding**, with over 8,000 healthcare workers laid off. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President's_Emergency_Plan_for_AIDS_Relief) Modeling studies project **74,000 to 100,000 excess HIV deaths** in Africa by 2030 attributable to these cuts.

Regional impacts varied by strategic priority. In Latin America, Colombia lost access to **$444 million annually** supporting peace implementation and Venezuelan migrant integration. [Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47721) In the Middle East, Syria saw 12 field hospitals close, with daily consultations dropping from 5,000 to 500. [University of Washington](https://depts.washington.edu/globalhealthjustice/global-health-catastrophic-from-the-2025-u-s-foreign-budget-freeze/) The Philippines had **$180 million** in tuberculosis, HIV, and disaster relief programs halted. [University of Washington](https://depts.washington.edu/globalhealthjustice/global-health-catastrophic-from-the-2025-u-s-foreign-budget-freeze/) Central American nations saw 70% of recipient organizations cut staff.

## China's record-breaking first half of 2025

Against this backdrop of American retreat, Chinese overseas engagement reached unprecedented levels. The first half of 2025 recorded **$124 billion** in BRI-related construction contracts and investments—nearly equaling the entire year of 2024 ($122 billion) in just six months. [Griffith](https://blogs.griffith.edu.au/asiainsights/china-belt-and-road-initiative-bri-investment-report-2025/) This represents the highest six-month engagement since the Belt and Road Initiative launched in 2013.

Several sectors drove this surge. Energy engagement reached **$42-44 billion** (the highest ever), with oil and gas processing accounting for approximately $30 billion and green energy contributing a record **$9.7 billion**. Metals and mining investment hit **$24.9 billion**, also a record. [Africa Center](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/china-africa-critical-minerals/) [Mail & Guardian](https://mg.co.za/news/2025-07-29-chinas-belt-and-road-shifts-focus-to-africa-with-record-breaking-investments/) Technology and manufacturing reached $23.2 billion. [Griffith](https://blogs.griffith.edu.au/asiainsights/china-belt-and-road-initiative-bri-investment-report-2025/)

The geographic distribution reveals strategic priorities. Africa topped all regions with **$39 billion** in H1 2025, [Green Finance & Development Center](https://greenfdc.org/china-belt-and-road-initiative-bri-investment-report-2025-h1/) driven by Nigeria's **$20 billion Ogidigben Gas Revolution Industrial Park** and Tanzania's standard gauge railway expansion. Central Asia received **$25 billion**, concentrated in Kazakhstan's $23 billion aluminum and copper processing facilities. The Middle East maintained strong engagement with **$7.2 billion** in Saudi Arabia and **$7 billion** in the UAE during H1 2025. [Griffith](https://blogs.griffith.edu.au/asiainsights/china-belt-and-road-initiative-bri-investment-report-2025/)

Average deal sizes doubled compared to previous years, reaching **$783 million** for construction contracts and **$1.24 billion** for investments. [Green Finance & Development Center](https://greenfdc.org/china-belt-and-road-initiative-bri-investment-report-2025-h1/) This contradicts Beijing's stated "small and beautiful" project pivot, suggesting resource-backed mega-projects remain central to BRI strategy where financial risks are manageable.

## Africa emerges as the primary battleground

Africa witnessed the most dramatic divergence between Chinese expansion and American contraction. Chinese construction contracts in Africa grew **395% from H1 2024 to H1 2025**, reaching $30.5 billion. [Green Finance & Development Center](https://greenfdc.org/china-belt-and-road-initiative-bri-investment-report-2025-h1/) Meanwhile, the US cut approximately **20-26%** of its annual $12.7 billion African aid portfolio.

The September 2024 FOCAC summit in Beijing—attended by **51 African heads of state**—pledged **$51.32 billion** over three years, including $29.6 billion in credit lines, $11.8 billion in various assistance, and commitments to 30 connectivity projects and 30 clean energy projects. Thirty African nations elevated their bilateral relationships with China to higher strategic partnership levels.

Documented cases of China filling American vacuums have emerged with striking clarity. On November 20, 2025, China announced **$3.49 million** in HIV prevention funding for South Africa—the first-ever Chinese HIV assistance to the country—explicitly following the termination of approximately $400 million in US PEPFAR funding. [China.org.cn](http://www.china.org.cn/2025-11/21/content_118188098.shtml) [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-20/china-boosts-south-africa-hiv-drive-huge-us-funding-gaps-remain) While a fraction of former American support, the symbolic significance marked Beijing's willingness to step into sensitive development spaces traditionally dominated by Washington.

In Nigeria, Chinese investment in the oil sector exceeded **$16 billion cumulatively**, with the $20 billion Ogidigben gas industrial park representing the largest single BRI construction contract announced in 2025. [Griffith](https://blogs.griffith.edu.au/asiainsights/china-belt-and-road-initiative-bri-investment-report-2025/) Nigeria established a dedicated government office in March 2025 specifically to streamline Chinese partnerships, while simultaneously losing **$600 million** in US health funding. The Lagos Rail Mass Transit Blue Line, built by Chinese contractors, began operations in May 2025.

The Africa CDC case illustrates the dynamic at the institutional level. When the US cut **$115 million** from a $500 million pledge, China and South Korea provided an emergency **$4 million contribution**. China had previously built the Africa CDC headquarters building and pledged an additional $500 million to the WHO.

## Latin America and the Pacific see intensified competition

China-Latin America trade reached a record **$518.47 billion in 2024**, [China News Service](https://www.ecns.cn/news/cns-wire/2025-05-14/detail-ihernfey9435916.shtml) surpassing Beijing's decade-old target of $500 billion. [English.gov.cn](https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202505/23/content_WS68306217c6d0868f4e8f2c7b.html) Chinese direct investment in the region totaled **$14.71 billion**, [English.gov.cn](https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202505/23/content_WS68306217c6d0868f4e8f2c7b.html) while overseas development finance rose to **$2.8 billion**—the highest in five years. [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/gdp/china-lac_bulletins/) At the May 2025 China-CELAC Forum, Beijing pledged nearly **$10 billion** in yuan-denominated credit lines.

Peru's Chancay Megaport represents perhaps the most strategically significant Chinese infrastructure project in the Western Hemisphere. Inaugurated November 14, 2024 by Presidents Xi Jinping and Dina Boluarte, the **$3.6 billion** deepwater port— [AidData](https://www.aiddata.org/blog/chancay-port-opens-as-chinas-gateway-to-south-america)  [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/11/14/china-peru-port-latin-america/) operated by COSCO Shipping Ports with a 60% stake— [The Interpreter](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/peru-s-new-megaport-reveals-refined-belt-road) positions China to bypass US ports for Asia-South America trade, cutting shipping time from 35 to 20 days. [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/china-peru-chancay-port-rcna124564) [Asia Times](https://asiatimes.com/2025/11/chinas-new-gateway-into-south-america-the-port-of-chancay/) US Southern Command's General Laura Richardson warned the facility could serve "dual-use" military purposes. [The Interpreter](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/peru-s-new-megaport-reveals-refined-belt-road)

Panama's ports became a flashpoint when Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison announced a **$22.8 billion sale** of 43 global ports to a BlackRock-led consortium in March 2025, including a 90% stake in Panama Ports Company. [Maritime Executive](https://maritime-executive.com/article/hutchison-sells-panama-and-other-ports-in-22-8b-deal-to-blackrock-and-msc) [WLT Report](https://wltreport.com/2025/03/04/report-panama-canal-now-under-american-control/) China blocked the deal through antitrust review, demanding state-owned COSCO receive a 20-30% stake with veto rights. [Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/17/panama-canal-ports-ck-hutchison-cosco-china-us-trump/) Given that **40% of US container traffic** transits the Panama Canal, the competition carries profound strategic implications.

Taiwan's diplomatic allies continue eroding. Since 2016, **ten countries** have switched recognition from Taipei to Beijing, including Panama (2017), El Salvador (2018), Nicaragua (2021), Honduras (2023), and Nauru (January 2024). [AidData](https://www.aiddata.org/blog/competition-continues-between-china-and-taiwan-for-latin-american-allies) Honduras's experience proves instructive: shrimp exports to Taiwan fell **67%** after switching, costing 14,000 jobs, while Chinese investment promises remained largely unfulfilled. Both leading 2025 presidential candidates pledged to restore Taiwan ties. [The Diplomat](https://thediplomat.com/2025/08/will-taiwan-regain-a-diplomatic-ally/)

In the Pacific Islands, China's **2022 security pact with Solomon Islands**—its first bilateral security agreement in the region—permits Chinese ship visits, logistical replenishment, and deployment of forces to "protect safety of Chinese personnel and major projects." [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/china-solomon-islands-security-pact-us-south-pacific) China provided **$730 million in aid** following the 2019 diplomatic switch. [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/china-solomon-islands-security-pact-us-south-pacific) Fiji's BRI engagement includes a **$300 million infrastructure project** for 22 bridges and road improvements, with direct Shanghai-Nadi flights announced for April 2025.

## Southeast Asia and the Middle East show divergent patterns

Southeast Asia exhibits complex dynamics where Chinese investment surges despite contested maritime claims. Thailand saw BRI engagement grow **2,373%** in H1 2025, receiving $7.4 billion in investments concentrated in EV battery manufacturing. Laos recorded **2,030% growth**, building on the operational Kunming-Vientiane railway funded by a **$3.54 billion** China Eximbank loan. [PLOS](https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation/article?id=10.1371/journal.pstr.0000194)

Cambodia represents the deepest alignment with Beijing. Chinese direct investment reached **$3.4 billion by 2024**, accounting for over one-third of all foreign direct investment. [Asia News Network](https://asianews.network/chinese-direct-investment-in-cambodia-hits-over-3-4-billion/) The **$1.7 billion Funan Techo Canal** broke ground in August 2024, [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/blog/why-china-investing-17-billion-canal-cambodia) while April 2025 saw Xi Jinping's state visit produce **37 cooperation agreements**.

[East Asia Forum](https://eastasiaforum.org/2024/05/01/chinas-continuing-influence-over-cambodias-economy/)

Indonesia navigated between powers while leaning toward Beijing. [Asia Society](https://asiasociety.org/policy-institute/electoral-equation-chinas-bri-investments-amid-political-transitions) President Prabowo's first foreign trip was to Beijing, where he signed a **$1 billion J-10C fighter jet purchase**. Indonesia joined both BRICS and the New Development Bank in 2025. The Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway—operational since October 2023 at a cost of **$7.3 billion**—carried over 12 million passengers by October 2025, though financial losses exceeding $200 million raised sustainability concerns.

The Philippines represents the clearest counter-example, strengthening ties with Washington amid South China Sea tensions. A **60-person joint task force** was announced in November 2024, [Broadsheet Asia](https://broadsheet.asia/2025/12/11/us-bolsters-defense-ties-in-southeast-asia-amid-south-china-sea-tensions/) while the Luzon Economic Corridor with Japan and the US pledged **$100 billion in investments**. The Philippines was designated a CHIPS Act partner country for semiconductor supply chain diversification.

The Middle East emerged as BRI's top destination in 2024, receiving **$39 billion** (up 102% year-over-year). Saudi Arabia alone accounted for **$18.9 billion**, [Sanchez](https://www.sanchez.vc/geocoded-special-reports/the-state-of-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-august-2025) including a $5.6 billion Riyadh subway contract [Sustg](https://www.sustg.com/middle-east-and-ksa-top-recipient-of-chinas-bri-investment-in-2024/) and exceeding $3 billion in clean energy investments with Chinese partners. [Peacediplomacy](https://peacediplomacy.org/2025/02/24/chinas-expanding-influence-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa/) The UAE received **$7 billion** in construction engagement during H1 2025, [Griffith](https://blogs.griffith.edu.au/asiainsights/china-belt-and-road-initiative-bri-investment-report-2025/) while Iraq signed an **$8 billion oil refinery deal**. [Sanchez](https://www.sanchez.vc/geocoded-special-reports/the-state-of-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-august-2025)

US aid cuts to the Middle East proved substantial: Morocco and Tunisia faced **100% reductions**, Iraq **93%**, non-military Egypt **84%**, and Jordan **61%**. Of 115 UN agency awards in the region reviewed, 48 were terminated.

## The correlation between US withdrawal and Chinese expansion is measurable

Timeline analysis reveals unmistakable patterns. The January 20, 2025 executive order freezing US foreign assistance [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_14169) preceded by approximately two months the acceleration visible in H1 2025 BRI data. While some Chinese projects were already in planning, the **400% surge in African construction contracts** and record overall engagement occurred precisely as USAID collapsed.

Specific country cases demonstrate direct vacuum-filling. Nigeria's $20 billion gas industrial park announcement and dedicated partnership office formation coincided with over $600 million in terminated US health programs. South Africa's first-ever Chinese HIV funding was announced the same month PEPFAR terminations devastated the healthcare system. Tanzania's railway expansion accelerated as US development presence contracted.

Regional diplomatic shifts reinforce economic patterns. **53 of 54 African nations** signed a joint statement supporting China's Taiwan reunification efforts in 2024. [Autonomous Control and Decision Systems Laboratory](https://sites.gatech.edu/econjournal/2025/03/27/opinion-seizing-the-moment-how-the-u-s-can-counter-chinas-economic-influence-in-africa/) A 2025 Afrobarometer poll found **60% of Africans view C
