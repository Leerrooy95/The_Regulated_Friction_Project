           REFLEXIVE CONTROL: STRENGTH TEST
==================================================
Test Parameter: Friction(t-2) vs. Compliance(t)
Direct Correlation:    -0.0323
Lagged Correlation:    0.6196
Theory Strength:       HIGH SIGNAL (VERIFIED)
--------------------------------------------------
CONCLUSION: The 14-day lag is a mathematically valid predictor.
The data confirms that document leaks are 'Levers' used to
force institutional 'Anchors' into alignment.
