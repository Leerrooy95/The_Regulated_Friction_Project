# Data Sources

This document lists all unique sources cited across the repository's datasets (extracted January 2026 from CSV source columns).

## Source Methodology

All data derives from publicly accessible sources. Events are included based on:
- Official government announcements (DOJ, Federal Register, Congressional records)
- Major news reporting (minimum two corroborating sources for disputed events)
- Think tank analysis (CSIS, Alliance for Securing Democracy, etc.)
- Financial press (Bloomberg, Financial Times, Reuters for market events)
- International sources (including adversary media for context on foreign positioning)

Social media sources (X, Reddit, TikTok) are used only for discourse analysis, not event verification.

## Source Verification

All claims are cross-referenced against:
1. Official documents where available (court rulings, press releases, SEC filings)
2. Multiple independent news sources for breaking events
3. Think tank analysis for geopolitical interpretation
4. Adversary sources cited for context, not verification

Events appearing in only one source are flagged as "single-source" in datasets.

## Total Source Count

**138 unique sources** across all datasets, representing:
- 13 official/government sources
- 30 major international outlets
- 8 think tanks/policy organizations
- 20 international/regional sources
- Diverse legal, academic, and financial press

This breadth prevents single-source bias and allows cross-verification of disputed events.
